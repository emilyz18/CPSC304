### Description
This project is an investment management system that specializes in the bond market and the stock
market. Our database is specifically designed to handle data related to publicly traded company stocks and bonds issued by both corporations and governments. Currently, this project enables users to input and manage their information, specify their financial market preferences, update their details, and remove their data from the database. Users can also search for accounts based on their criteria, review attributes across different tables in the database, and execute various queries.
